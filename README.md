# Mercury

This repo was called `agent-runs` until 2026-10-02. The Azure resources keep that name, so the live URL did not change.

A FastAPI agent loop that streams its steps over SSE and resumes from the last event after a dropped connection. Run state lives in PostgreSQL, so more than one replica serves the same run. Deployed to Azure Container Apps at scale to zero by GitHub Actions.

The service builds as one image, runs under `docker compose` against Postgres with pgvector, and answers `GET /health`. The design is in `docs/design.md`. The claims table below fills in as each test goes green and not before.

## Running it locally

```
docker compose up --build --wait
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

That prints `{"status":"ok"}`. The same image serves both roles, chosen by the `ROLE` environment variable, which is `api` or `worker`. The worker arrives at task 3.

The tests need a Postgres to work against. They use `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, not `DATABASE_URL`, because they drop and recreate the public schema and `DATABASE_URL` points at a real project in a local `.env`. A non local host is refused unless you set `ALLOW_REMOTE_TEST_DB`.

The default is `agent_runs_test` on the compose Postgres, which the fixtures create, and deliberately not the `agent_runs` database the stack itself uses. A running worker polls that one, and it will claim a run a test has just created and write its own steps into it. The tests pass with the stack up because of that separation, not by luck.

```
docker compose up -d db --wait
uv sync
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
```

## The page at `/`

The API serves a built page from `web/dist` at `/`. It is registered after every API route, so `/health`, `/runs`, `/runs/{id}`, `/runs/{id}/events` and `/checks/*` never reach it, and any other GET gets the page. `tests/test_web_page.py` asserts both sides of that. It is a Vite, React and TypeScript app in `web/` that lists every run newest first, 50 at a time, with its type, source, provider, executor, status, tokens and duration, and an Older runs button that follows the endpoint's keyset cursor, which `web/test/runs-list.test.tsx` tests at the page boundary.

Each run id links to `#/runs/<id>`, which streams that run's events as they land. A Kill connection button closes the stream the way a dropped network would, and Reconnect opens a new one from the last event seen, with a marker row where the drop happened. The browser holds no token, so the page gets step numbers, kinds and the final status, and never the code, test output or diffs inside them, which need the bearer token. A browser `EventSource` cannot set `Last-Event-ID` on a new connection, so the page resumes with `?after=<id>`, and the header wins when both are sent. `useRunStream` merges events by id, so a row the server sends twice shows once, and it closes the stream on `done` so the browser does not keep reconnecting. `web/test/run-stream.test.tsx` covers the merge on reconnect, the duplicate id and the close on done against a fake `EventSource`, and `tests/test_events_without_token.py` covers the API side.

On the live deploy on 2026-10-01, run `ff9e0edd` was opened on the page and the connection killed after event #235, the retrieve step. The worker carried on with nobody listening. Reconnect, 62.3 seconds later, asked for everything after #235 and got #236 act, #237 verify and #238 done, once each, ending `succeeded`, with the drop marked between #235 and #236.

Every run records its `source`, the thing that asked for it, which is `telegram`, `mcp`, `n8n`, `api` or `scheduler` (migration 012). The webhook, the chat and the Open it anyway button write `telegram`, and the scheduler Job posts `scheduler`. A caller of `POST /runs` may name `api`, `n8n` or `scheduler` and gets `api` when it names nothing. `telegram` and `mcp` are written inside the app, so a POST naming either is a 422, as `tests/test_run_source.py` checks. Rows from before the column read `api`. `GET /runs/{id}` returns one run with the same fields as the list, and a 404 for an id it does not know.

## Resume, and the test that proves it

The test opens a stream, lets steps 1 to 3 arrive while it is connected, drops the
connection, lets steps 4 and 5 happen with nobody listening, then reconnects with
`Last-Event-ID` set to the last event it saw. It asserts that no event is repeated,
none is lost, and six events are delivered in total.

```
tests/test_resume.py::test_stream_replays_every_event_then_closes_on_done PASSED [ 33%]
tests/test_resume.py::test_dropping_a_live_stream_and_reconnecting_resumes_exactly_once PASSED [ 66%]
tests/test_resume.py::test_unknown_run_is_not_found PASSED               [100%]

============================== 3 passed in 2.23s ===============================
```

The tests run against a real uvicorn on a real socket rather than an in process test
client, because an in process client buffers the response instead of delivering it
chunk by chunk and so cannot drop a live stream part way through.

The same thing by hand, against the compose stack started with `MERCURY_BEARER_TOKEN` exported, replaying from event 1. A pytest run's events sit behind the bearer token, for the reason under "What the agent does".

```
$ curl -s -N -H "Authorization: Bearer $MERCURY_BEARER_TOKEN" -H "Last-Event-ID: 1" localhost:8000/runs/$RUN/events
id: 2
event: done
data: {"kind": "done", "status": "succeeded"}
```

Nothing about a connected client is held in the server. The events table is the
whole cursor, which is what lets a reconnect land on any replica.

### The same thing against a real run

Posting a task, dropping the connection part way through, and reconnecting. The
agent is Gemini 3.8 Flash on its free tier. Steps 1 to 3 arrive while the client
is connected, the client drops the socket, the verify step runs with nobody
listening, and the reconnect asks for everything after event 3.

```
run: 0d33b20c-1686-4827-a038-8af2724cbff7
[first pass] HTTP 200, Last-Event-ID sent: None
[first pass] event id=1 kind=plan seq=1
[first pass] event id=2 kind=retrieve seq=2
[first pass] event id=3 kind=act seq=3
[first pass] >>> connection dropped after 3 events

... steps continue on the server with nobody listening ...

[after reconnect] HTTP 200, Last-Event-ID sent: 3
[after reconnect] event id=4 kind=verify seq=4
[after reconnect] event id=5 kind=done seq=5
```

Events 4 and 5 arrive once each and nothing is repeated. The run finished
`succeeded` in one attempt, 167 tokens, 14.8 seconds, having written this from
the supplied pytest file alone:

```python
import re


def tokenise(text: str) -> list[str]:
    return re.findall(r"\w+|[^\w\s]", text)
```

### What a run costs

Measured on the two runs above, both solved on the first attempt: 167 and 325
tokens, 14.8 and 22.6 seconds. The per run budget is 50000 tokens, so the cap is
far above what the demo task needs. It exists for the case where the agent keeps
failing and retrying.

## Two replicas, one port

Compose runs two api replicas. Neither publishes a host port, so nginx is the
only way in and a client cannot pin itself to one of them. nginx re-resolves
Docker's DNS on every request, which is what spreads them.

```
$ for i in $(seq 8); do curl -sD- -o/dev/null localhost:8000/health | grep -i x-replica; done | sort | uniq -c
      6 x-replica: 13f2ed018fc0
      2 x-replica: 78634d84dabc
```

Every response names the replica that served it, so a test can show a reconnect
moved between processes rather than assuming it.

`tests/test_two_replicas.py` reads three events, drops the socket, writes three
more while nobody is connected, then reconnects with `Last-Event-ID` until the
proxy sends it to the other replica. It asserts that no event is repeated, none
is lost, and six arrive in total.

```
tests/test_two_replicas.py::test_a_stream_dropped_on_one_replica_resumes_on_the_other PASSED [ 50%]
tests/test_two_replicas.py::test_both_replicas_answer_through_the_one_port PASSED [100%]

======================= 2 passed, 56 deselected in 0.30s =======================
```

Run with one replica instead of two, both tests fail. Nothing about a connected
client lives in the api process, so there was no cursor to move. That is the
whole point of putting the events table in the middle.

These need the stack up, so they are marked `integration` and left out of the
default run. The run they create needs the bearer token, so the stack and the
test share one.

```
export MERCURY_BEARER_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
docker compose up --build -d --wait
AGENT_RUNS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 uv run pytest tests/test_two_replicas.py -m integration
```

## A claim that outlives its worker

A worker killed outright cannot release its claim, so the claim carries a lease.
The worker refreshes `heartbeat_at` as it records each step, and a run whose
heartbeat has gone stale past `LEASE_SECONDS` can be taken over by another
worker. A run that already finished is never reclaimed.

The replacement worker continues from the last recorded seq rather than starting
again, so the steps the dead worker committed stay committed and its token spend
still counts against the budget. `tests/test_idempotent.py` and
`tests/test_loop.py` cover the takeover, the heartbeat, and the resume.

## What the agent does

You post a pytest file with the bearer token. The agent writes the function that makes it pass. Verification is pytest's exit code, run in a subprocess with a timeout, a scrubbed environment, and both of Python's socket layers disabled.

That is a demo guard, not isolation, and the difference matters. The worker container itself has a network, because it calls the model and Postgres. Disabling `socket` and `_socket` stops generated code reaching out by accident, and `tests/test_sandbox.py` asserts that both a plain `socket.create_connection` and a raw `import _socket` fail. It would not stop code written to get out.

The scrubbed environment keeps keys out of the subprocess's own environment and no further. A subprocess running as the worker's user can still read the worker's environment from `/proc`, database URL and model keys included, and print it into the verify output. In the image the worker is root, so pytest runs as a separate `sandbox` user instead, and a worker that is root with no such user refuses to run the file at all. Checked in the built image on 2026-09-30 with a fake key in the worker's environment, a posted test that reads `/proc/1/environ` ran as uid 998 and got `PermissionError`. The same test against the previous image ran as uid 0 and printed the key.

The sandbox user closes that one path. The file still runs with the container's network, so posting a pytest run, and reading its events, needs the bearer token. Until 2026-09-30 anyone could do both.

The subprocess starts with the socket module replaced, so the code under verification cannot open a connection. `tests/test_sandbox.py` asserts that a test which calls `socket.create_connection` fails, that a solution which loops forever is killed at the timeout, and that a wrong answer comes back with pytest's output rather than an exception.

## The worker and the loop

The worker claims a run with one `UPDATE ... WHERE claimed_by IS NULL`, so two workers racing for the same run produce one winner and one no-op.

A model provider returning an error must not take the worker down with it. A failed call is retried with a growing wait, and a run that still cannot finish is closed with a `done` event carrying `status: error`, so a client waiting on the stream is not left hanging. This was not theoretical: the first live run against Gemini hit a 503, the worker had no handler, and the container died leaving the run claimed and its stream open forever. It then runs plan, retrieve, act, verify, and repeats until the verifier passes or the token budget is gone. Retrieval is a stub until task 5.

Each step writes one `steps` row and one `events` row in a single transaction, both keyed on `(run_id, seq)` with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. A worker that dies and is replaced repeats the same seq and writes nothing twice.

## Retrieval

The corpus is 35 chunks of Python standard library notes in `corpus/`, indexed
into the `chunks` table when the worker starts. Indexing is keyed on
`(source, ord)`, so restarting the worker adds nothing.

There are two retrieval paths behind one interface. With `VOYAGE_API_KEY` set,
chunks carry embeddings and the search is cosine distance in pgvector. Without
it, the search is Postgres full text search over the same rows. This README says
retrieval, not vector, because the numbers below came from the full text path.
The vector path is tested against real pgvector with a deterministic offline
embedder, so the SQL is proven even without a key.

Asking for the chunk behind a regular expression task returns this:

```
python_stdlib  ->  re.split(pattern, string) splits on a pattern rather than a fixed separator...
python_stdlib  ->  unittest.mock is rarely the answer in tests. Prefer passing a real object...
python_stdlib  ->  re.findall(pattern, string) returns every non overlapping match as a list...
```

============================== 15 passed in 3.37s ==============================
```

Two things about the corpus are worth saying plainly. Postgres full text search
joins every term of a query with AND by default, which means a chunk only matches
when it contains all of them, and a pytest file never does. The query is rewritten
to match any term and rank the result. Second, the repo's own README and design
docs were in the corpus first, as the spec asked. They crowded the standard
library notes out, because they are full of the same words a pytest file uses
while saying nothing about how to write Python. The corpus is reference material
only now, and the spec records why.

## Live on Azure

Deployed by GitHub Actions with an OIDC federated credential, so there is no
stored cloud secret. This repo's `deploy.yml` runs the two replica test against
compose and pushes the image to GHCR tagged with its commit, and deploys
nothing. The private config repo's workflow checks this repo out at a commit it
pins by hand, runs `infra/deploy.sh` with that commit's image and its own
`mercury.yaml`, and polls the live health endpoint through a cold start. A push
here changes nothing live until that pin moves.

A run posted to the deployed service, streamed over SSE from Container Apps:

```
--- plan (seq 1)
--- retrieve (seq 2)
--- act (seq 3) ---
from functools import reduce


def initials(name: str) -> str:
    """Return the initials of a name in the format 'X.Y.'."""
    words = name.split()
    return reduce(lambda acc, word: acc + f"{word[0].upper()}.", words, "")
--- verify (seq 4): passed=True timed_out=False
=== done: succeeded after 1 attempt(s) ===
```

That run finished in one attempt on 223 tokens. The retrieve step had returned
this chunk, which is why the answer reaches for `functools.reduce` rather than a
loop:

```
functools.reduce folds a binary function over an iterable, with an optional initial value.
```

Both apps scale to zero. The worker starts when there is an unfinished run and
stops again afterwards. Nothing runs, and nothing is billed, between demos.

### What the ingress does to a long stream

Container Apps cuts any HTTP request at 240 seconds on the consumption plan.
Keepalives do not extend it, and raising it needs premium ingress, which is paid
and therefore out of scope here. A run that takes longer than that will have its
stream cut by the platform, and the client has to reconnect with `Last-Event-ID`
and carry on, which is exactly the path this repo exists to make work. The
reconnect is free because the events table is the cursor.

## A scheduled run with nobody watching

A Container Apps Job named `agent-runs-scheduler` wakes on the hour, reads the
site list from `mercury.yaml`, and posts a `site_check` run to the API with the
bearer token. It then checks the site with a plain HTTP request in the same
process, writes the result as the run's one step, and closes the run. No model
is called and no browser is connected. The Job exits when it is done, so it
costs nothing between runs, and the API and worker stay at zero replicas until
it wakes them. The worker never claims a `site_check` run, because it would
otherwise race the scheduler for it and count it against the daily limit.

The real `mercury.yaml` lives in a private repo, whose workflow passes it to the
Bicep when it deploys. A deploy without it gives the Job a placeholder listing
no sites.

The Job's own log line, exactly as Log Analytics holds it for container
`agent-runs-scheduler`, from an execution started with `az containerapp job start`:

```
{"timestamp": "2026-09-23T10:16:47.614108+00:00", "level": "INFO", "logger": "agent_runs.scheduler", "message": "scheduled run a9f4b60f-4ff1-4f6f-872e-cbb61a216c62 created with no client", "run_id": "a9f4b60f-4ff1-4f6f-872e-cbb61a216c62"}
```

The same run from the live `GET /runs`, closed in 84 ms with 0 tokens:

```
{
    "id": "a9f4b60f-4ff1-4f6f-872e-cbb61a216c62",
    "type": "site_check",
    "provider": null,
    "executor": null,
    "status": "succeeded",
    "tokens": 0,
    "duration_seconds": 0.083938,
    "created_at": "2026-09-23T10:16:47.591056+00:00"
}
```

A site that fails three checks in a row is suspended until something resumes
it. A POST the API refuses counts as a failure too, so a wrong or expired token
suspends the schedule rather than skipping every site each hour with nothing to
show for it.

## CI, dependencies, a daily digest, and retention

The same hourly Job looks after the repos listed under `portfolio.repos`. Each of these is a `site_check` with its own `check_kind`, created through the API and closed by the scheduler itself the way uptime is, because the task registry gains no new type until every claim is green. Neither worker can claim one. `POST /checks/claim` refuses to hand them out and `tests/test_claim_endpoints.py` asserts it for each kind.

A `ci_watch` runs every hour per repo. It reads the newest completed run of each workflow on the repo's default branch from the GitHub Actions API, and a workflow whose newest run ended `failure`, `timed_out` or `startup_failure` is failing. A failure the previous watch had not seen sends one Telegram message, unless one was sent for that repo in the last 24 hours, in which case it waits for the digest. A red CI is a finding and the check still succeeds. Only a GitHub call that fails counts towards the three failures that suspend the watch.

A `dependency_audit` runs once every 7 days per repo. It lists the repo's files through the GitHub API, reads every `uv.lock` and `package-lock.json` outside `node_modules`, and sends the pinned versions to OSV.dev. This is not `pip-audit` or `npm audit`. OSV carries the PyPA and GitHub advisory databases those tools read, and querying it from the lock files means the image needs neither tool and no Node. Only lockfile versions 2 and 3 are read, which npm 7 and later write. The findings go in the digest only. Run against the real APIs on 2026-10-01, this repo's three lock files pinned 417 packages, audited in 5.2 seconds, with three moderate advisories, two on `oauthlib` 3.3.1 and one on `pyjwt` 2.14.0. Both came in through the Azure Monitor exporter. Locking `oauthlib` 4.0.0 and `pyjwt` 2.15.1 cleared them, and the same check then found none in the 79 Python packages.

The digest is due at 07:30 in `telegram.timezone`. The Job fires on the hour in UTC, so the first tick after that, at 08:00 Melbourne time, creates one `digest` run a day, and the worker writes and sends it. It gathers the last 24 hours of uptime per site, the latest Lighthouse scores beside the previous run's, broken links, failing CI, dependency advisories, suspended schedules and run counts, with every list cut to 10 items. Gemini writes the message from those facts and is told to use only them, with Ollama as its fallback. If the model does not answer after its 4 tries, the facts go out as plain text, so a provider outage costs the wording and not the digest.

Every tick also applies retention. A finished run older than 30 days loses its task input and every step's input and output, and each of its events keeps only its step number and kind, plus the status on the done event, which is what a caller with no token already sees. So a reconnect a month later still replays the run. A `site_check` keeps everything, because its first step is the summary the digest compares week over week. A run older than 365 days is deleted with its steps and events. Both windows come from `retention` in `mercury.yaml`.

The scheduler Job holds the bot token and the GitHub token from `5de9ce5` on. Before that it held neither, so on the live deploy a site's third failure suspended its check but could not send the Resume message.

## A weekly check on a self hosted worker, with a cloud fallback

Lighthouse and the broken link crawl need a real browser, so they run in `checks/`, a Node 22 worker on a machine of my own rather than in the API image. For each page listed under `portfolio.pages` in `mercury.yaml`, the hourly scheduler Job posts a `lighthouse` and a `broken_links` check whenever none of that kind was created for that page in the last 7 days, and leaves them pending. The worker claims them through `POST /checks/claim` with the bearer token, which cannot claim any other run type, runs them, and posts a summary of about 1 KB.

A pending `lighthouse` check that no self hosted worker claims within `CHECK_CLAIM_WINDOW`, 30 minutes by default, is taken by the Python worker and run on the PageSpeed Insights API. A `broken_links` check never falls back, because PageSpeed cannot crawl, so it waits for the machine to wake. A posted result closes the check whatever it says.

The crawl follows same origin links breadth first to depth 3 and 200 pages, with a 10 second timeout per request, skips what `robots.txt` disallows, and reports only 4xx, 5xx, timeouts and refused connections, keeping the first 50 with the page each was found on. On the machine that runs it, `docker compose -f checks/compose.yml up -d --build` starts the worker with Chromium and `restart: unless-stopped`, reading `API_BASE_URL` and `MERCURY_BEARER_TOKEN` from a gitignored `.env` beside it.

The worker polls once an hour, set by `POLL_SECONDS`. It first polled once a minute, and because Container Apps keeps a replica while requests arrive less than 5 minutes apart, the API held one replica from 2026-09-28 14:25 UTC until the worker was stopped at 04:29 UTC the next day. It reached zero replicas 6 minutes after the last poll.

`tests/test_checks_integration.py` runs in CI's compose job against the stack's own runs page, with the window cut to 20 seconds and PageSpeed pointed at a port where nothing listens, so the fallback records an error as its finding without calling Google. Real Lighthouse runs in the checks container. From CI run 459c206:

## Telegram, and its cold start

The bot is how I reach the service from a phone. Telegram posts each message to `POST /telegram`, which checks the secret token header first and refuses everyone when no secret is configured, then checks the chat id against an allowlist of one. Any other chat gets a 200 and no reply, and its text is not logged. `/status`, `/runs` and `/cancel` are answered in the webhook with no model call. `/cancel` writes the run's `done` event and clears its claim, so a worker still running it fails its next fenced write and stops.

Free text gets an "On it." reply at once and becomes a `chat` run for the worker, which holds the model key, so the webhook never waits on a model. The model sees the task types it may start and the last 20 turns of the chat, and answers with either a run to create or one question. The run it creates takes over the "On it." message and edits it after every step, so a run appears in the chat as one message that changes rather than one message per step. A model that still fails after its retries closes the run, and the message says so. Every update that passes the checks gets a 200 even when the reply fails to send, because Telegram retries anything else and a retried `/cancel` would run twice. The tests stand `tests/telegram_fake.py` in for Telegram's API.

### The cold start, measured

Each answer logs how long after the message was sent it went out, from the `date` Telegram stamps on every message. On the first message after the API has scaled to zero, that figure is the cold start as the sender feels it. On 2026-09-30 the API reached zero replicas at 23:06:06 UTC, and a `/status` sent at 23:32:24 produced this line, exactly as Log Analytics holds it for container `agent-runs-api`:

```
{"timestamp": "2026-09-30T23:32:42.999490+00:00", "level": "INFO", "logger": "agent_runs.telegram", "message": "answered /status 19.0 s after it was sent", "trace_id": "b18accea459617d4a05e09b5aff56475", "span_id": "b45154bf7451c07c"}
```

Telegram's `date` has whole second resolution, so the true figure lies between 19.0 and 20.0 seconds. The Container Apps system log for the same wake shows where it went. The replica was assigned 2.4 seconds after the message was sent, the 166 MB image was pulled in 7.7 seconds and done by 10.0, the container started at 13.2, one startup probe failed at 14.2, and the reply went at 19.0.

The first measurement, on 2026-09-29 with a 132 MB image, was 26.1 seconds, of which about 14 went on the image pull. The image grew by 34 MB when git was added for repo chores, yet the pull took half as long, so pull time varies between wakes by more than the image size explains. These are two samples, not a distribution. A warm `/status` on 2026-09-28 answered in 2.6 seconds, and free text got its "On it." in 2.1 seconds.

## A pull request from a Telegram message

A message asking for a change to a repo listed in `mercury.yaml` becomes a `repo_chore` that waits for an Approve button. Once approved, the worker clones the repo, branches as `agent/<run id>`, lets the model rewrite whole files, and runs the repo's own `test_command`. The branch is pushed and a pull request opened only when the tests pass and the change keeps every test the repo already has. A chore that cannot get there ends `escalated` with nothing pushed; the next section says what happens then.

The approval sits at run creation, in `app/chores.py`, so it does not depend on where a chore comes from. A `repo_chore` posted to `POST /runs` with `inputs.repo` is created `awaiting_approval` and the same question goes to the owner's chat. A repo outside `portfolio.repos` is a 422, and with no bot token or chat id configured it is a 503 that leaves no run behind, because a chore nobody was asked about would wait 24 hours for nothing. `tests/test_repo_chore_approval.py` covers both sources.

`tests/test_repo_chore_github.py` runs that whole path against the real public repo `thomas-whitley/mercury-fixture`, with the stub model and the fake Telegram. The message goes into the webhook, the chat run turns it into a chore, the test presses Approve, and the worker opens a real pull request. The test then checks the pull request on GitHub, and closes it and deletes its branch whatever happened. It needs a token that can push to the fixture, so it is marked `integration` and skips without one.

```
$ MERCURY_GITHUB_TOKEN=... uv run pytest tests/test_repo_chore_github.py -m integration -o addopts= -v -s
tests/test_repo_chore_github.py::test_a_telegram_message_opens_a_pull_request_on_the_fixture

============================== 1 passed in 10.76s ==============================
```

From the Approve press to the chore ending took 5.3 seconds on the first run, covering the clone, the fixture's tests, the push and the two GitHub calls. [Pull request 2](https://github.com/thomas-whitley/mercury-fixture/pull/2) stays on the fixture, closed, as the record.

## Evals

An eval task is one YAML file in `evals/chores/`: the repo, an instruction that names every file and function it expects, and a grade test. There are 11, 8 small exact ones on a calculator and a text module and 3 on a standard library `orders` package, all on the public fixture repo `thomas-whitley/mercury-fixture`. The grade test never reaches the model. Mercury runs the chore as it runs any other, and the runner grades the branch afterwards on its own clone. A result passes when it still has every test id `main` has and skips none of them, its own tests pass, and the grade test passes. A result that drops or skips one of `main`'s tests fails, whatever the grade says.

After a run, each failed row can get one hint. `python -m evals.rescue brief` writes the instruction, the last diff, the tail of the repo's own test output and the reason the chore stopped, never the grade test or its output. A Claude session writes one hint per row from that, and `python -m evals.rescue apply` sends each one through `POST /runs/{id}/advise` on the column the chore failed on, then grades the rerun the same way. For the `delegate.ps1` columns the hint is added to the instruction and the script is run again.

```bash
MERCURY_URL=<deploy> uv run python -m evals.runner --columns gemini,ollama --repeats 3
uv run python -m evals.rescue brief evals/results/<stamp>.json
uv run python -m evals.rescue apply evals/results/<stamp>.json evals/results/<stamp>.hints.yaml
uv run python -m evals.rescue table evals/results/<a>.json evals/results/<b>.json
```

The columns, measured on 2026-10-07 and 2026-10-08:

- `gemini` and `ollama` are Mercury's two free cloud rungs on the live deploy, 3 repeats of the 11 tasks.
- `local` is `qwen2.5-coder:7b`, an untuned 7B model on an RTX 4060 with 8 GB, run through Mercury in the local compose stack (`local/README.md`), 3 repeats.
- `delegate:local` (`qwen3-coder:30b`) and `delegate:local-gpt` (`gpt-oss:20b`) are OpenCode on the same desktop through `delegate.ps1`, 1 repeat each, because 2 attempts at more were stopped when the desktop ran out of memory.

| Column | Passed first time | Passed after one hint | Mean pass rate | Passed at least once | Opened a PR | Median tokens | Median seconds | Cost USD | Fell back | Weakened tests | Unusable replies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| delegate:local | 9 of 11 | 10 of 11 | 82% | 9 of 11 | 10 of 11 | n/a | 103 | 0.0000 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| delegate:local-gpt | 6 of 11 | 8 of 11 | 55% | 6 of 11 | 9 of 11 | n/a | 119 | 0.0000 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| gemini | 33 of 33 | n/a | 100% | 11 of 11 | 33 of 33 | 1300 | 11 | 0.0000 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| local | 7 of 33 | 11 of 33 | 21% | 5 of 11 | 12 of 33 | 2338 | 19 | 0.0000 | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| ollama | 28 of 33 | 31 of 33 | 85% | 11 of 11 | 28 of 33 | 3681 | 18 | 0.0000 | 0 | 0 | 10 |

Passed after one hint counts a row that passed first time or passed on its one rerun; `n/a` means no row of the column needed one. Mean pass rate is the mean of each repeat's first time pass rate. The results, briefs and hints are in `evals/results/` (`2026-10-07T1318Z` live, `2026-10-07T1308Z` compose, `2026-10-07T1436Z` delegate). Most of `local`'s failures were the reply format rather than the change: files named `path` or `content`, the two characters `\n` written for a line break, and a whole file rewritten without the code it already had.

## When a chore escalates

A chore runs on its type's provider ladder, `[gemini, ollama]` by default and set per type under `tasks:` in `mercury.yaml`. A provider that fails hands the run to the next rung, and a run that is reclaimed after a crash keeps only the rungs below the one it reached. A chore ends `escalated`, with its reason on the run row and in `GET /runs`, in four cases. Its tests are still red after 3 attempts. Its 3 replies were not the JSON asked for. Its last attempt passes the tests by leaving the repo as it was. Or its tests pass but its diff removes or skips a test the repo already has, three times running. That last check reads the staged diff (`app/test_guard.py`), so it works for any language. A green attempt that drops a test is not pushed. The model is told which test it dropped and shown the repo's own copy of the file, and tries again. In the Phase 1 eval, 6 of the 10 failed results were a green change that had dropped one of `main`'s tests.

An escalated chore sends one Telegram message to the owner's chat with the reason, the tail of the test output, a link to the run page, and the Open it anyway button when it left a diff. A reply to that message is a hint, and so is `/hint <text>`, which goes to the newest chore waiting for one. It reruns the chore from `main` with the hint, the failed diff and its test output in the prompt, and it starts without Approve because the owner is the one advising. The MCP tool `advise(run_id, hint)` does the same, and so does `POST /runs/{id}/advise`, which may also name a free provider for the rerun. A chore takes 2 advised reruns. When the second also escalates, the run is marked for a Claude session and `advise` refuses a third. Eval chores and a second escalation of the same chore send no message. A model that never answers on any rung ends the run in error, and the hourly scheduler Job retries it up to 3 times before escalating it.

`GET /report`, the MCP tool `report` and `scripts/mercury_report.py` give one Markdown page. It lists escalations first, with every run of the chore and its provider, tokens, cost, hint, last diff and test output. Then come chores Mercury started itself, then where the eval results are, then spend against each cap. The morning digest adds one line when a chore is waiting for a hint.

The last rung is a Claude session. The MCP server's instructions tell it to read `report`, write a sharper hint through `advise` first, and do the chore itself on a local clone only when it judges the task beyond free models, saying why in the pull request.

## An MCP server for Claude Code

The API serves an MCP server at `/mcp`, built on the official Python `mcp` SDK (2.2) and mounted in the FastAPI app, so it adds no process, image or secret. It speaks streamable HTTP, stateless with JSON responses, so any replica answers any request and nothing is kept between calls. Every request must carry the bearer token, checked with the same constant time compare as `POST /runs`, and one without it is a 401 before the SDK sees it.

There are eight tools. `advise` and `report` are described in the section above. `create_run`, `list_runs`, `get_run` and `get_run_events` call the same functions as `POST /runs`, `GET /runs`, `GET /runs/{id}` and the event stream (`app/run_api.py`). `cancel_run` and `status` give the same answers as `/cancel` and `/status` on Telegram. Runs created here are written `source: mcp`, and anything `POST /runs` would refuse comes back as a tool error with the same status and reason. There is no approve tool. A `repo_chore` created here waits for the Approve button on Telegram like any other, and `create_run`'s description tells the client so. It is meant for Claude Code, which can send a header:

```
claude mcp add --transport http mercury <api url>/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

The claude.ai connector UI wants OAuth, which this server does not do.

On 2026-10-02 the server was added to Claude Code that way against the live deploy of `4311534`, where `claude mcp list` showed it connected. Asked to queue a pytest run through `create_run`, Claude Code created it, and the live `GET /runs/{id}` reads:

```

## Observability

A run is one trace across both roles, not two unrelated ones. `POST /runs` opens a
root span and stores its W3C `traceparent` on the run row. The worker restores that
context as current before the loop starts, not just once per step, so its five step
spans, plan, retrieve, act, verify, done, each carrying the step kind, the provider,
and its tokens, land as children of the api's root span, and so does a log line from
anywhere in the loop, including a failure that writes no step. A run whose lease
went stale and was picked up by a replacement worker gets one more child span,
marked as a takeover, so the trace shows where the first worker's spans stop and the
second's begin. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` is set per role in the Bicep, so Application
Insights tells the api and the worker apart by `cloud_RoleName` instead of showing
both as `unknown_service`.

Checked against the live deployment, not just the unit tests: one run's `operation_Id`

```

The first test is the regression that survived one whole session undetected:
`FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app` works by patching `build_middleware_stack`, and
Starlette calls that method itself on the first ASGI scope the app receives,
including the lifespan startup scope, which runs before the lifespan function's own
body does. Instrumenting from inside the lifespan therefore patches a method that has
already been called, and nothing raises to say so. `create_app()` instruments before
returning the app, which is before uvicorn sends it anything.

Every process also writes structured JSON to stdout, which the managed environment
ships to the workspace on its own, not through the telemetry exporter, so logs keep
working in CI, in compose, and on a machine with no exporter configured. A line
carries a timestamp, level, logger, message, and whatever the call site passed as
`extra`; the trace and span ids come from whatever span is current when the line is
emitted. Neither a task's input body nor a model's output is ever logged.

```

```

## A note on free tier quotas

`MAX_RUNS_PER_DAY` caps runs, not model calls, and one run makes up to ten calls
while it retries. Gemini's free tier allows 20 calls a day on `gemini-3.8-flash`,
so a handful of failing runs exhausts it. When that happens the run is closed
with `status: error` rather than hanging, which is what the error path is for.
`gemini-3.5-flash-lite` has a larger free allowance.

## Guards

Three numbers are configuration, not code. `TOKEN_BUDGET` is 50000 per run and is counted in the loop. `MAX_RUNS_PER_DAY` is 20 by default, set per deploy from the private repo's `MAX_RUNS_PER_DAY` Actions variable (40 since 2026-10-07), and is counted in the worker from `runs.created_at`, and a refused run still gets its `done` event so a client waiting on the stream is not left hanging. `MODEL=stub` runs the loop with an offline model that needs no key, which is what CI uses so a push costs nothing.

Two more caps sit above a run's own budget, and both are configuration too. `DAILY_TOKENS_PER_PROVIDER` is 500,000 tokens a day for each provider and `MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD` is 5. Before a run that calls a model starts, the worker adds up the tokens every step has recorded today on its provider, and this month across all of them. Gemini's free tier counts as nothing toward the month, and Haiku is charged at its output price on every token, since a run stores total tokens only, so the monthly figure can only overstate the bill. A tripped cap ends the run with one `done` event whose status is `budget` and names the cap, and sends one Telegram message to the owner's chat. A run that spends its own `TOKEN_BUDGET` sends the same one message.

The loop talks to a `Model` protocol with one `complete` method. As of Mercury step 1 the provider is no longer read from `MODEL`: each task type in `app/tasks.py` names a provider, and `PROVIDERS` in `app/config.py` maps that name to a kind, a base URL, a model, and the env var holding its key. `pytest`, `repo_chore` and `digest` name `gemini`, whose key is `MODEL_API_KEY`. `chat` names `ollama`, which is `gpt-oss:120b` on Ollama's cloud free tier at `https://ollama.com/v1`, whose key is `OLLAMA_API_KEY`. The registry also carries `haiku`, whose key is `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and no type names it. A run whose provider has no key configured is refused, the same way a run past the daily limit is, so its stream closes with `status: refused` rather than staying claimed forever. `.env.example` lists the three key variables.

Each type also names a fallback, `ollama` for the Gemini types and `gemini` for chat. On 2026-10-01 both live chat runs ended in error because Gemini answered `503 This model is currently experiencing high demand` to all 4 tries. Now the first failed call switches the run to its fallback, and the retry the loop already makes is what reaches it, 2 seconds later, so a step takes no longer than it did with one provider and stays inside the 2 minute lease. The run's `provider` column then names the fallback, so the runs list and the daily token cap count the provider that answered. A fallback with no key configured is skipped, and the run carries on with its own provider. `tests/test_fallback.py` covers the switch, the retry reaching the fallback, and the column. Against the real API, `gpt-oss:120b` answered the chat prompt in 0.9 to 1.8 seconds with 400 to 460 tokens, and turned "add a docstring to greet() in mercury-fixture" into a `repo_chore` on that repo.

On the live deploy of `4dc7c5f`, `GET /runs` on 2026-10-02 lists both providers answering their own types, with no fallback taken.

The last is the first live digest, at 08:00 Melbourne time. The model wrote it from the gathered facts and it was sent. A site from the private config and the Google project number in PageSpeed's error are left out below.

```
Attention needed: Uptime check failed for https://<private site>/ with status code 403, and Lighthouse page https://agent-runs-api.grayriver-8b441372.australiaeast.azurecontainerapps.io/ returned an error (Quota exceeded for quota metric 'Queries' and limit 'Queries per day' of service 'pagespeedonline.googleapis.com').
Everything else was fine: https://agent-runs-api.grayriver-8b441372.australiaeast.azurecontainerapps.io/health passed all 24 checks, dependencies and CI runs had no vulnerabilities or failures, and chat and pytest runs succeeded.
