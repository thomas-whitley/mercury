"""Retention, run by the scheduler Job on every tick.

A finished run older than event_bodies_days loses its bodies: the task input,
every step's input and output, and every event's output, so a reconnect a month
later still replays each step's seq and kind and the done event's status, the
same shape a caller with no token sees (app/stream.py without_body). A
site_check keeps everything, because its step 1 is the summary the digest
compares week over week. A chore's model calls go at the same age, except
a bank run's, which are Phase 5's training data. A run older than runs_days
goes, steps, events and model calls with it.

Both statements only touch rows that still have something to remove, so a
second pass in the same hour finds nothing.
