"""An MCP server at /mcp, inside the API, for Claude Code.

Streamable HTTP from the official `mcp` SDK, stateless with JSON responses,
so any replica answers any request and nothing is held between calls. Every
tool calls the same functions as the HTTP routes (app/run_api.py) and the
Telegram commands, so the registry, the caps and the chore gate apply
unchanged. Runs created here are written source mcp.

There is no approve tool. A chore created here waits for the Approve button
on Telegram like any other, which is the point: the owner's phone stays the
only place a chore starts. The one exception is a repo marked auto_approve in
mercury.yaml, which is meant for the throwaway fixture the evals run on.
