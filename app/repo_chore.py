"""The repo_chore executor, per docs/mercury.md.

A chore clones the repo into a temporary directory, branches as
agent/<run id>, lets the model rewrite whole files, and runs the repo's own
test command. Green pushes the branch and opens a pull request. Three red
attempts, or three replies that could not be used, end the run escalated
with its reason, the diff and the test output in its done event, and nothing
leaves the machine. A model that never answers, on any provider, ends it in
error as an outage, which the scheduler retries. The runner never merges and never
pushes to anything but its own branch.

The branch reaches the remote only after the tests pass, so a branch already
there means a worker got that far and then died. A takeover then skips the
model and the tests and only makes sure the pull request exists.

The test command runs in a subprocess with a timeout and an environment that
holds no secret, only PATH, a throwaway HOME and the locale. In the image the
worker is root, so the command runs as the unprivileged chore user instead,
which cannot read the worker's environment through /proc. It has network,
because a repo's tests need their dependencies, so it is not isolation. The
GitHub token reaches git only as an HTTP header in git's own environment, so
it is never written to .git/config, never in a URL and never in a step.
