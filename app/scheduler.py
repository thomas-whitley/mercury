"""ROLE=scheduler: a Container Apps Job that wakes on a cron trigger, checks
the configured sites, creates any weekly browser check that is due, and
exits. It creates each uptime run through the API with the bearer token, so
the run exists with no client attached to watch it, then executes and closes
the run itself in the same process. Each run also applies the retention
cleanup (app/cleanup.py). A plain HTTP check needs no browser and
no separate worker, and the agent loop worker never claims uptime runs (see
_CLAIMABLE in app/worker.py).

The CI watch works the same way, one ci_watch run per configured repo,
read from the GitHub Actions API, and so does the weekly dependency audit
(app/audit.py). Once a day it creates the digest run, which the worker
writes and sends (app/digest.py).

The weekly lighthouse and broken_links checks are only created here. The
self hosted checks worker claims them, and a lighthouse check nobody claims
within the window falls back to PageSpeed on the Python worker.
