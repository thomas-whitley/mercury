"""POST /telegram, the bot's inbound half, per docs/mercury.md.

Telegram's secret token header is checked first and fails closed when no
secret is configured. Then the chat id is checked against the allowlist of
one; any other sender gets a 200 and no reply at all. A reply to a chore's
escalation message is a hint for it (app/advice.py). /status, /runs and
/cancel are answered here with no model call. Anything else becomes a chat
run for the worker (app/chat.py).

Every update the check lets through is answered with 200, even when the
reply fails to send, because Telegram retries anything else and a retried
/cancel would run twice.
