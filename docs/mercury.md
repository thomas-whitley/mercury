# Mercury

Mercury is the second phase of this repo. agent-runs proved that an agent loop can stream its steps over SSE, survive a dropped connection on any replica, and keep its state in Postgres. Mercury turns that loop into an always available runner: it takes typed tasks from a queue, runs them on a schedule or on a message from a phone, and looks after a small portfolio of repos and one production website. The properties it adds are scheduling with scale to zero, budgets, approvals, and more than one model provider in one deploy. `docs/design.md` still describes the loop, the resume protocol and the data model; this file describes what sits on top.

## What stays the same

One image, one Postgres, N stateless API replicas, one worker. The worker still claims a run with a lease and writes one `steps` row and one `events` row per step in one transaction. A client still reads `GET /runs/{id}/events` and resumes with `Last-Event-ID`. Nothing about the resume protocol changes.

## Task types

A run has a type. The type registry is a table in code, one row per type, and each row names the tools the loop may call, the default provider and the token budget.

| Type | Input | Result | Default provider |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pytest` | a pytest file | a function that passes it | Gemini free tier |
| `chat` | one Telegram message plus the last 20 turns | one reply | Gemini free tier, Claude Haiku 4.5 selectable |
| `repo_chore` | a repo name and an instruction | a pull request | Gemini free tier, Claude Haiku 4.5 selectable |
| `site_check` | a URL | a report | none, no model call |
| `digest` | nothing | a summary of the last day's checks | Gemini free tier |

Nothing is added to this table until every row is green in the README.

## Execution

The loop is the same hand rolled plan, retrieve, act, verify. What changes is that act now dispatches to a typed tool registry, and the registry a run sees is the one its task type names. `chat` sees read only tools over the runner's own state (list runs, read a run's events, the portfolio status from the last checks) plus one write, create a task. It cannot touch a repo or the site. Every side effect goes through a typed task, so the autonomy ceiling and the budgets apply to all of them.

The provider is chosen per task type from config. A `Model` implementation exists for the stub (CI), any OpenAI compatible endpoint (Gemini's free tier is the default) and the Anthropic SDK. Two task types on two providers in one deploy is one of the README claims.

## Autonomy ceiling

The runner may open pull requests and write drafts. It never merges and never publishes. A merge can become an approval button later; it is not in this phase.

## Repo chores

A `repo_chore` clones the repo into a temporary directory inside the worker container, branches as `agent/<run id>`, makes the change, runs the repo's own tests, pushes the branch and opens a PR. If the tests still fail after 3 attempts, or the change removes or skips a test the repo already has, the run ends `escalated` with its reason, the diff and the test output in the final event, and no PR is opened. The owner can press Open it anyway, which creates a new run that reapplies the diff, or reply with a hint (see Escalation below).

Auth is a fine grained GitHub personal access token in Container Apps secrets, scoped to the named repos, contents and pull requests only, one year expiry. It cannot push to `main` because branch protection on each repo forbids it, and the runner never tries.

Takeover: the worker heartbeats every 30 seconds and the lease is two minutes. A replica that finds an expired lease takes the run over. The clone was local to the dying container, so the chore restarts from the beginning. That is safe because the first step checks whether `agent/<run id>` already exists on the remote and resumes from it if so.

## Escalation

Settled 2026-10-05 and 2026-10-07 (decisions 6 to 19 of `docs/build-brief-evals.md`). Each model type has a provider ladder, read from `tasks:` in `mercury.yaml`; a failing provider hands the run to the next rung. A chore ends `escalated` with one of four reasons: `tests still failing after 3 attempts`, `three unusable replies`, `no change to the repository` (green only because nothing changed), or `weakened tests`. The last is a green attempt whose diff removes or skips one of the repo's tests, which gets feedback naming the test and only escalates on the third attempt. A model that never answers on any rung ends the run `error` with `providers unavailable`. The hourly Job retries it up to 3 times and then escalates it. A budget trip keeps its own `budget` status and message.

One Telegram message per escalated chore, none for a chore whose source is `eval` and none for a second escalation of the same chore. A reply to it, `/hint <text>` for the newest chore waiting, or the MCP tool `advise(run_id, hint)` creates an advised rerun from `main` that starts without Approve. A chore takes 2 advised reruns, then it is marked `needs_claude` and `advise` refuses. The report (`GET /report`, MCP `report`, `scripts/mercury_report.py`) lists escalations, chores Mercury started itself and spend against the caps. A Claude session reads it, advises first, and does a chore itself only when it is beyond free models.

`POST /runs/{id}/advise` (`{"hint": ..., "provider": ...}`, behind the bearer token) is the same advise over HTTP, for the eval's rescue pass (decisions 47 to 50 of `docs/build-brief-evals.md`). It may name a free provider for the rerun. An eval chore can also be advised after it opened a pull request that failed its hidden grade, and the rerun of an `eval` or `bank` chore keeps that source, so it tells nobody. `GET /runs/{id}/history` returns a run's events as one JSON list, behind the bearer token, for a client that does not read the event stream.

## Other ways in: MCP and n8n

Telegram is not the only thing that asks for runs. Two more callers come in through the same API, and neither adds a task type.

**One approval gate.** A `repo_chore` waits for Approve on Telegram whatever created it. The gate is at run creation (`app/chores.py`), so a chore from chat, from a direct `POST /runs`, from the MCP server or from n8n gets the same question and the same 24 hour expiry. Every run records its `source`, one of `telegram`, `mcp`, `n8n`, `api` or `scheduler`, which `GET /runs`, `GET /runs/{id}` and the runs page show.

**An MCP server at `/mcp`.** Streamable HTTP, from the official Python `mcp` SDK, mounted inside the existing FastAPI app, so it needs no new process, image or secret. Every tool sits behind the existing bearer token with the same constant time compare as `POST /runs`. The tools are `create_run`, `list_runs`, `get_run`, `get_run_events`, `cancel_run` and `status`, and each calls the same functions the HTTP routes call, so the daily run limit, the provider and dollar caps and the registry apply unchanged. There is no approve tool. A chore created over MCP waits for the button like any other, and `create_run`'s description says so, so the client tells the user to check Telegram. It is for Claude Code, which can send a bearer header. The claude.ai connector UI wants OAuth, which is out of scope.

**n8n on the home PC.** n8n runs self hosted in Docker beside the checks worker, and nothing of it is in Azure. One workflow polls `thomas-whitley/mercury-fixture` every 15 minutes for open issues labelled `mercury`, because the home PC has no public address and a tunnel is a new moving part. Each new issue becomes a `repo_chore` posted to `POST /runs` with `source: n8n` and the issue's title and body as the instruction. Mercury asks for approval on Telegram. n8n polls the run until it ends, comments on the issue with the pull request link or the failure reason, and removes the label. It dedupes by issue number in the workflow's static data. Its credentials, the bearer token and a fine grained token scoped to the fixture repo, live in n8n's own store, and the committed workflow carries credential ids only.

## Scheduling

A Container Apps Job with a cron trigger posts to the API. It is declared in the same Bicep as the apps, so the deploy workflow shows it, and it runs inside the same free grant. The API and the worker still scale to zero between runs; the Job only wakes them when there is work. An in process scheduler was rejected because it needs a replica awake all month, which alone would cost about 3.6 times the free grant. `pg_cron` was rejected because it would tie the schedule to the database plan.

The default schedule: site uptime hourly (plain HTTP, no model call), CI failure watch hourly (GitHub Actions API for the named repos), Lighthouse and broken links weekly, dependency audit weekly per repo (`pip-audit` or `uv` for Python, `npm audit` for Node), stale PR and issue triage weekly, and the digest daily. A cleanup task runs on the same Job and deletes event bodies older than 30 days. Run rows and check summaries are kept a year, which is what makes a week over week comparison in the digest possible.

## Two executors for one task type

The checks that need a real browser run somewhere else. Lighthouse and Playwright are Node libraries, and putting Chromium in the API image would cost image size and cold start for a check that runs once a week. So `site_check` has two executors and the runner picks whichever is available.

`checks/` is a small Node service, in this repo, that runs on a self hosted machine. It declares which check kinds it can run, claims one pending check at a time, runs it locally, and posts the result back. It talks to the API over HTTPS with a bearer token and never holds a database credential, so the machine it runs on holds exactly one secret. It owns Lighthouse and the broken link crawl, weekly. Uptime and the CI failure watch stay in the cloud on the hourly Job, because they are plain HTTP and should not depend on a machine that sleeps.

Three endpoints serve it, all behind the bearer token: claim one pending check, extend its lease, post its result. Claim only ever returns a `site_check` of the kinds the worker declared. It cannot return a `pytest`, `chat`, `repo_chore` or `digest` run, so the token on the self hosted machine is a strictly weaker credential than the one a session uses, by construction rather than by convention.

When the machine is asleep the Lighthouse work does not stall. A pending Lighthouse check that nobody claims within a configurable window, thirty minutes by default, is taken by the cloud executor over the PageSpeed Insights API. A broken link check has no cloud fallback and waits for the self hosted machine, because PageSpeed cannot crawl and the crawl is written once, in `checks/`. It runs weekly, so a machine asleep for a day delays it by a day. A claimed check whose lease expires goes back to pending under the same two minute lease the Python worker uses, and the same window then applies to it. A check that comes back with a verdict is finished, whatever the verdict is: a result saying the site returned 500 is a successful check with a bad finding, not a reason to run it again somewhere else.

A Lighthouse result is stored as about a kilobyte: the five category scores, largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and the ids of the audits that failed. The full report is discarded. The crawl is same origin only, depth three, two hundred pages, ten second request timeout, robots.txt respected, and it reports only 4xx, 5xx and timeouts. Which executor ran a check is recorded in its own column, separate from the model provider, so the provider column keeps one meaning.

## Telegram

The bot receives updates by webhook, not long polling, for the same reason the scheduler is a Job: polling needs a replica awake. The first message after idle pays a cold start of a few seconds, and the README states the measured figure.

Inbound: the webhook checks Telegram's secret token header and then the chat ID against an allowlist of one. Every other sender gets no reply at all.

Free text goes to the model with the task registry as a structured output schema. The model either picks a type with its inputs filled or asks one clarifying question. `/status`, `/runs` and `/cancel` bypass the model. A `repo_chore` always echoes the repo and the instruction and waits for a button press before it starts; every other type starts at once.

Progress is one message edited in place as SSE events land, not one message per step. Approvals are inline keyboard buttons. Each pending approval is a row with the action, the run, an expiry and the Telegram message ID; the callback carries the row ID. An approval nobody answers expires after 24 hours and its run ends `cancelled`.

Conversation memory is a bounded window of the last 20 turns per chat in Postgres, plus the retrieval corpus already in the loop.

A failed scheduled task sends one message. The same task failing again within 24 hours goes in the digest instead, so a broken site does not page every hour.

## Budgets

Three caps, all config: tokens per run (default 50,000), tokens per day per provider (default 500,000), dollars per month. A tripped cap ends the run with one `budget` event and one Telegram message. The Azure budget alert at $5 a month stays as the outer guard.

## Configuration

The public repo ships the image and a sample config in `config/mercury.sample.yaml`. A private repo holds the real config: each task type's provider ladder and budget, schedules, the chat ID, the list of repos and the site URL, plus a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys the public image with that config. Secrets live in that repo's Actions secrets and in Container Apps secrets. The private repo pins an image tag and the tag is bumped by hand, so a public commit cannot change what talks to the phone before its owner has read it.

## The runs page

`web/` is a Vite, React and TypeScript app compiled to static assets and served by the API at the root. It lists runs with type, source, provider, executor, status, tokens and duration, newest first, and opening one streams its events live. The interesting part is a `useRunStream` hook that holds an `EventSource`, merges arriving events into existing state by their monotonic id, survives a reconnect with `Last-Event-ID` without duplicating rows, and drives the kill connection button that lets a visitor drop the socket and watch the resume happen. Its scope stops there: no approvals and no chat view, because Telegram owns both.

The API serves the bundle rather than nginx. The nginx in the compose file exists only so the two replica test has one port, and the cloud deployment runs the API directly, so serving from nginx would make local and production disagree about the one thing the page demonstrates. API routes take precedence and unmatched paths fall through to the page.

`GET /runs` is newest first with keyset pagination on the created timestamp and id, fifty rows by default and two hundred at most, counted against the same rate limit as the other public endpoints. Keyset rather than offset, because run rows are kept a year and an offset scan degrades and skips rows as new runs arrive.

The image is built in two stages: a Node stage compiles `web/`, and the Python stage copies the output. `web/` and `checks/` are separate npm projects that import nothing from each other, both on Node 22, pinned in the build stage and in CI.

## What is public

Run metadata (type, source, provider, executor, status, tokens, duration) is public and shows on the runs page. Event bodies are behind a bearer token. A `public` flag per task type would let a type's runs be posted and shown in full without it, and no type sets it. `pytest` did until 2026-09-30, when a scan showed that a posted pytest file runs as the worker's user and can read the worker's keys from `/proc`, then print them into its own events. The browser never authenticates: it shows metadata for every run, which is why there is no login and no token in any page. Sessions and other clients authenticate with one static bearer token from secrets, rotated by redeploy. Rate limits on the public endpoints are unchanged.

## Observability

Two signals, for two different jobs. Structured logs are what you debug with. Traces are what show the shape of a run.

Every process writes JSON to stdout, which the container environment already ships to the workspace. Logs are deliberately not routed through the telemetry exporter, because they have to work in CI, in local compose and on the self hosted machine, none of which have an exporter configured. Logs must not go dark when tracing is off. A line carries a timestamp, level, logger, message, the run id, the run type, the step sequence, the worker or replica id, and the trace and span ids injected from the current span context. The self hosted worker writes the same fields, minus the trace and span ids it does not have, plus the executor. The field set is defined here so two languages have one place to agree.

Two things never appear in a log line: a task's input body and a model's output. A repo chore's input is an instruction about someone's code and its output is a diff. Tokens and secrets never, as everywhere else.

A run is one trace. The API creates a root span when the run is created and stores the trace context on the run row; the worker restores it before the loop starts, so the spans it produces belong to the same trace rather than a second unrelated one. Each loop step is a child span carrying the step kind, the provider and the tokens, which is about five spans per run. A run taken over by a second worker after a lease expiry stays in the same trace, with a child span marked as a takeover, so the trace shows the first worker's spans stopping abruptly and the second's beginning.

The self hosted check worker stays outside the trace on purpose. Making it a span means shipping an ingestion credential to a machine outside the cloud deployment, for a process that runs two checks a week. It logs with the run id instead, and the API logs the result arriving inside the run's trace, so the trace still shows the check completing. When a check fails it sends back the last fifty lines of its log with the result, so a failure is debuggable from the runs page without touching that machine.

Cost is bounded by the workspace's own daily ingestion cap rather than by sampling, because sampling would hide the runs worth looking at. The cap has a failure mode: once it is hit, ingestion stops for the day, so a task failing in a loop would burn the day's budget exactly when the evidence matters. The answer is that a scheduled task failing three times in a row is suspended until it is resumed from Telegram, which bounds log volume, model spend and notification noise with one mechanism.

## Tests

Telegram is a fake HTTP server in the test suite that records sent messages and replays button callbacks. GitHub is a public throwaway repo, `mercury-fixture`, that one integration test runs a real chore against, opening and then closing a PR. Python unit tests never touch the network. Telemetry is tested with an in memory span exporter rather than a real connection string, and one test asserts the OpenTelemetry middleware is actually present in the built middleware stack, because its failure mode is otherwise silent. `web/` is tested with Vitest and React Testing Library against a fake `EventSource`, covering the merge on reconnect and the duplicate id case. `checks/` has fast unit tests with a faked HTTP side and a stubbed Lighthouse call, plus one integration test that runs a real Lighthouse against a locally served page. Everything marked `integration` runs only in the compose job.

## Claims for this phase

Eight rows join the README's claims table. Each goes green only when a test or a measured log line proves it.

| Claim | Proof |
| --- | --- |
| A scheduled task runs with no client connected | Job log line plus the run row |
| A Telegram message opens a PR on a named repo | integration test against `mercury-fixture` |
| The webhook cold start is measured and stated | timed log lines from the live deploy |
| A budget trip ends a run with one event and one message | unit test with the fake Telegram |
| Two task types run on two providers in one deploy | run rows with two provider names |
| A dropped browser stream resumes from the last event without duplicating rows | Vitest test against a fake `EventSource`, and the live page |
| A weekly check runs on a self hosted worker and falls back to the cloud path when it is offline | integration test exercising the fallback window |
| One run is one trace across the API and the worker, with the context carried on the run row | in memory span exporter test asserting both share a trace id |
| Claude Code queues and reads Mercury runs through its MCP server, and cannot approve them | in process MCP client test, and a `source: mcp` run row from the live deploy |
| An n8n workflow turns a labelled GitHub issue into an approved pull request | green on the live deploy, not in CI: the issue, the `source: n8n` run, the PR and the issue comment |

## Build order

0. Observability first, because every step below adds a process. The four tracing faults, structured logging in both processes, the middleware assertion test and the enabled path test.
1. Task registry and provider per type, plus `GET /runs` and its serializer. `pytest` keeps working.
2. Scheduled Job in Bicep, the `site_check` type, the three claim endpoints and the `checks/` worker. First claim green.
3. Telegram webhook, `chat`, progress messages. Cold start measured.
4. Approvals table and `repo_chore`, against `mercury-fixture`.
5. `digest`, audits, cleanup. Then 5f, the approval gate at run creation, the `source` column and the MCP server, and 5g, the n8n workflow.
6. README claims and the runs page in `web/`.

Each step shows something from the phone before the riskiest piece, repo chores, lands. The run list endpoint is in step 1 rather than step 6 because the chat tools and `curl` both want it long before a page does. Steps 2 and 6 are each several hours of work, so the build brief splits them into lettered commits with an exit condition apiece.

## Out of scope

Merging or publishing anything. More than one user. A GitHub App (the install flow and JWT exchange buy nothing here). Full conversation history with embeddings. Any browser UI beyond the runs page, and any authentication in the browser. OAuth for the MCP server, which the claude.ai connector UI would need.
